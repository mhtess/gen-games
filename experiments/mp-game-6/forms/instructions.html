        <p>
          Your goal is to learn how to identify creatures that belong to a specific species.
          In the game, you are guaranteed to be paired with another player and assigned the role of "explorer" or "student". 
          <br> <br>
          <b>Explorer:</b> If you are the explorer, you will receive a creature detector and a
          grid of creatures to inspect. You can use the creature detector by clicking on any
          creature in the grid. If a clicked creature belongs to the species, the detector
          will present it with a dashed box. Once you have clicked on all the creatures in the grid
          take a moment to think about the properties of the creatures that belong to the species.
          When you are ready to proceed, you will continue to a chatroom where you communicate your
          findings about the species to your student partner. Once the student feels confident in
          their understanding of the species, they will progress the game forward.
          You will then be given a new grid of test creatures. This time you will not have your creature
          detector. You will click on the creatures that you believe belong to the species.
          The creatures you select will be highlighted with yellow boxes.
          Once, you are confident that you have identified all the creatures that belong to the species,
          you will continue, repeating this process (grid exploration, chatroom communication,
          grid identification) for a total of 5 different species of creatures.
          <br> <br>
          <b>Student:</b> If you are the student, you will first wait for 1-2 minutes until the explorer
          has examined the grid of examples with the assistance of their creature detector.
          Then you both will enter a chatroom, where you can discuss the properties of the species
          with the explorer as long as you need. Once you feel you have a good understanding of the
          species properties (you may chat as long as you want) you will continue from the chatroom. Finally, you will be a given a test grid
          of creatures. You will click on the creatures that you believe belong to the species.
          The creatures you select will be highlighted with yellow boxes. Once, you are confident
          that you have identified all the creatures of the given species, you will repeat this process
          (waiting for explorer, chatroom communication, grid identification) for a total of 5
          different species of species.
          <br> <br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of each test grid, you will receive a
          score:
          (# creatures correctly labeled as species members - # creatures incorrectly labeled species members)
          At the very end, we will sum together your scores across the rounds with
          <b>your partner's scores</b> across the rounds. This will be the total score for both players.
          You will each get <b> a bonus of $0.01 per point</b>, so pay attention and communicate effectively
          with your partner during the chatroom! Negative scores will be rounded up to 0,
          so you cannot lose any money.
        </p>

        <p> A few final notes: you may see this screen before the game begins:
          <p>
            <center><img src="../../_shared/images/waitroom.png" alt="initial wait screen" style="width:700px;height:150px">
            </center>
          </p>
          Just hold tight. In order to proceed with the hit you will
          need another player. This player should join the game automatically within
          the next few minutes. If you're in the waiting room 15 minutes
          without another player joining, please email us to let us know
          (schopra8@stanford.edu).
        </p>

        <p>
          Second, please be respectful of the worker you're playing
          with: try to be as responsive as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
          you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
          refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
          and you may not be able to submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
        </p>

        During the game, you are guaranteed to be paired with another player.

        Players will have as much time in the chatroom as they want, to discuss what they learned with their partner.

        <br>
        After each chatroom, the explorer and student will be asked to identify creatures within the species from a grid of creatures that the explorer did not see during that round's exploration.
        <br>
        <input type="radio" name="message" value="yes"> True
        <br>

        The amount of money in your bonus, depends solely on your performance.
