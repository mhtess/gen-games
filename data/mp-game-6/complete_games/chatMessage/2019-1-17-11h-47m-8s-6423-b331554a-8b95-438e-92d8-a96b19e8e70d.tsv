The one thing that all the kweps did have in common is that the front"" petals on the flower (the 5 petals that are in front of the other 5 petals) are lighter than the ""back"" petals. So if the front petals are lighter, that seems to make it a kwep. Wish I could tell you more"""	65.2	chatMessage	I	Q
